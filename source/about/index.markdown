I'm currently a fourth year Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia doing an Honours and this is my blog.

I spend my free time programming and skiing, but rarely both at the same time.

I enjoy learning about and experimenting with new technologies and languages - especially those related to video games. Right now I have a fascination with mobile platforms.
